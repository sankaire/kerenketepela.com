I literally have 20 followers on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tepela2), okay I don't know why I mention that. anyhoo just so you know this is my first blog. it has no content just random words that I was thinking while writing it.

### Why did I decide to start ranting on the internet?

I thought I could reach out to more people to tell them about my thoughts and opinions which will vary from technical, life, hobbys and even other people stories (in tech). Also I want to leave my traces on the internet 😏.

### Why did I create my own bloging thing?

Well there's alot of blogging plartforms out there. I created mine because I wanted to be cool like [This guy](https://twitter.com/the_kibuika) 😎, but fo real here are the reasons

- Post what I want.
- brand my self.

Maybe they are not vallid reasons, maybe I just wanted to.

### What topics will I stress on?

I know I already talked about this but in general, mostly I will be ranting about things that I am learning, challenges I encounter while doing engineering, and how I solved my challenges also my life outside engineering. On top of this I may write about people's stories on how they got into tech(This is everywhere).

I hope you will enjoy. welcome to my rants🍧
